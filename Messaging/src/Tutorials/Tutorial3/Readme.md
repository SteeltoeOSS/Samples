In the [first tutorial](../Tutorial1/Readme.md) we showed how
to use Visual Studio to create a solution with two projects
with the Steeltoe RabbitMQ Messaging dependency and to create simple
applications that send and receive string hello messages.

In the [previous tutorial](../Tutorial2/Readme.md) we created
a sender and receiver and a work queue with two consumers. 
We also used Steeltoe attributes to declare the queue.  
The assumption behind a work queue is that each task is delivered to exactly one worker.

In this part we'll implement a fanout pattern to deliver
a message to multiple consumers. This pattern is also known as "publish/subscribe"
and is implemented by configuring a number of RabbitMQ entities using Steeltoe attributes.

Essentially, published messages are going to be broadcast to all the receivers.

Exchanges
---------

In previous parts of the tutorial we sent and received messages to and
from a queue. Now it's time to introduce the full messaging model in
RabbitMQ.

Let's quickly go over what we covered in the previous tutorials:

 * A _producer_ is a user application that sends messages.
 * A _queue_ is a buffer that stores messages.
 * A _consumer_ is a user application that receives messages.

The core idea in the messaging model in RabbitMQ is that the producer
never sends any messages directly to a queue. Actually, quite often
the producer doesn't even know if a message will be delivered to any
queue at all.

Instead, the producer can only send messages to an _exchange_. An
exchange is a very simple thing. On one side it receives messages from
producers and the other side it pushes them to queues. The exchange
must know exactly what to do with a message it receives. Should it be
appended to a particular queue? Should it be appended to many queues?
Or should it get discarded. The rules for that are defined by the
_exchange type_.

<div class="diagram">
  <img src="../img/tutorials/exchanges.png" height="110" alt="An exchange: The producer can only send messages to an exchange. One side of the exchange receives messages from producers and the other side pushes them to queues."/>
</div>

There are a few exchange types available: `direct`, `topic`, `headers`
and `fanout`. We'll focus on the last one -- the fanout. Let's setup
our Receiver with an exchange of this type, and call it `tut.fanout`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Attributes;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Config;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Receiver
{
    [DeclareExchange(Name = "tut.fanout", Type = ExchangeType.FANOUT)]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue1")]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue2")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue1", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue1}")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue2", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue2}")]
    internal class Tut3Receiver
    {
        private readonly ILogger _logger;

        public Tut3Receiver(ILogger<Tut3Receiver> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        } 
		....
	}
}
```

We follow the same approach as in the previous tutorial and use attributes to declare our RabbitMQ entities. 
We declare the `FanoutExchange` using the `DeclareExchange` attribute. We also
define four additional RabbitMQ entities, two `AnonymousQueue`s (non-durable, exclusive, auto-delete queues
in AMQP terms) using the `DeclareAnonymousQueue`and two bindings (`DeclareQueueBinding`) to bind those queues to the exchange.

Notice how we tie together these entities. First, the name of the exchange is `tut.fanout` and the two anonymous queues are named `queue1` and `queue2`.
Next, the bindings reference both the exchange name (e.g. `ExchangeName = "tut.fanout"`) and the queue name (e.g. `QueueName = "#{@queue2}"`). Notice we use
the `expression language` we mentioned in the previous tutorial to in the queue name reference.

The fanout exchange is very simple. As you can probably guess from the
name, it just broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the
queues it knows. And that's exactly what we need for fanning out our
messages.

> The first parameter is the routing key and the `RabbitTemplate`

> bound to the default exchange with the name of queue as the binding key.
> This is why we can use the name of the queue as the routing key to make
> sure the message ends up in the queue.

Now, we can publish to our named exchange instead:

```csharp
namespace Sender
{
    public class Tut3Sender : BackgroundService
    {
		internal const string FanoutExchangeName = "tut.fanout";
		private readonly RabbitTemplate _rabbitTemplate;

		public Tut3Sender(ILogger<Tut3Sender> logger, RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate)
		{
			_logger = logger;
			_rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate;
		}
	
	
        protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
        {
            while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
				// ....
                await _rabbitTemplate.ConvertAndSendAsync(FanoutExchangeName, string.Empty, message);
			}
		}
	}
}

```

From now on the `fanout` exchange will append messages to our queues.

Temporary queues
----------------

As you may remember previously we were using queues that had
specific names (remember `hello`). Being able to name
a queue was crucial for us -- we needed to point the workers to the
same queue.  Giving a queue a name is important when you
want to share the queue between producers and consumers.

But that's not the case for our fanout example. We want to hear about
all messages, not just a subset of them. We're
also interested only in currently flowing messages, not in the old
ones. To solve that we need two things.

Firstly, whenever we connect to the broker, we need a fresh, empty queue.
To do this, we could create a queue with a random name, or --
even better -- let the server choose a random queue name for us.

Secondly, once we disconnect the consumer, the queue should be
automatically deleted. To do this with Steeltoe Messaging,
we defined an _AnonymousQueue_, using the `DeclareAnonymousQueue` attribute
which creates a non-durable, exclusive, auto-delete queue with a generated name:


```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Attributes;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Config;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Receiver
{
    [DeclareExchange(Name = "tut.fanout", Type = ExchangeType.FANOUT)]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue1")]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue2")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue1", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue1}")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue2", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue2}")]
    internal class Tut3Receiver
    {
        private readonly ILogger _logger;

        public Tut3Receiver(ILogger<Tut3Receiver> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        } 
		....
	}
}
```

At this point, our queues have random queue names. For example,
it may look something like `spring.gen-1Rx9HOqvTAaHeeZrQWu8Pg`.

Bindings
--------

<div class="diagram">
  <img src="../img/tutorials/bindings.png" height="90" alt="The exchange sends messages to a queue. The relationship between the exchange and a queue is called a binding." />
</div>


We've already created a fanout exchange and a queue. Now we need to
tell the exchange to send messages to our queue. That relationship
between exchange and a queue is called a _binding_. Below you can see that we have two bindings declared using the `DeclareQueueBinding` attribute , one for each
`AnonymousQueue`.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Attributes;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Config;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Receiver
{
    [DeclareExchange(Name = "tut.fanout", Type = ExchangeType.FANOUT)]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue1")]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue2")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue1", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue1}")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue2", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue2}")]
    internal class Tut3Receiver
    {
        private readonly ILogger _logger;

        public Tut3Receiver(ILogger<Tut3Receiver> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        } 
		....
	}
}
```

> #### Listing bindings
>
> You can list existing bindings using, you guessed it,
> ```bash
> rabbitmqctl list_bindings
> ```

Putting it all together
-----------------------

<div>
  <img src="../img/tutorials/python-three-overall.png"/>
</div>

The producer program, which emits messages, doesn't look much
different from the previous tutorial. The most important change is that
we now want to publish messages to our `fanout` exchange instead of the
nameless one. We need to supply a `routingKey` when sending, but its
value is ignored for `fanout` exchanges. 

Here goes the code for `Tut3Sender.cs` program:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Core;
using System.Text;

namespace Sender
{
    public class Tut3Sender : BackgroundService
    {
        private readonly ILogger<Tut3Sender> _logger;
        private int dots = 0;
        private int count = 0;

        internal const string FanoutExchangeName = "tut.fanout";
        private readonly RabbitTemplate _rabbitTemplate;

        public Tut3Sender(ILogger<Tut3Sender> logger, RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate;
        }
   

        protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
        {
            while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                _logger.LogInformation("Worker running at: {time}", DateTimeOffset.Now);
                var message = CreateMessage();
                await _rabbitTemplate.ConvertAndSendAsync(FanoutExchangeName, string.Empty, message);
                _logger.LogInformation($"Sent '" + message + "'");
                await Task.Delay(1000, stoppingToken);
            }
        }

        private string CreateMessage()
        {
            StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder("Hello");
            if (++dots == 4)
            {
                dots = 1;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < dots; i++)
            {
                builder.Append('.');
            }
            builder.Append(++count);
            return builder.ToString();
        }
    }
}
```

As you see, we leverage dependency injection and add the `RabbitTemplate` to the constructors signature.
Note that messages will be lost if no queue is bound to the exchange yet,
but that's okay for us; if no consumer is listening yet we can safely discard the message.

Next the code for `Tut3Receiver.cs`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Attributes;
using Steeltoe.Messaging.RabbitMQ.Config;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Receiver
{
    [DeclareExchange(Name = "tut.fanout", Type = ExchangeType.FANOUT)]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue1")]
    [DeclareAnonymousQueue("queue2")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue1", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue1}")]
    [DeclareQueueBinding(Name = "tut.fanout.binding.queue2", ExchangeName = "tut.fanout", QueueName = "#{@queue2}")]
    internal class Tut3Receiver
    {
        private readonly ILogger _logger;

        public Tut3Receiver(ILogger<Tut3Receiver> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }


        [RabbitListener(Queue = "#{@queue1}")]
        public void Receive1(string input)
        {
            Receive(input, 1);
        }

        [RabbitListener(Queue = "#{@queue2}")]
        public void Receive2(string input)
        {
            Receive(input, 2);
        }

        private void Receive(string input, int receiver)
        {
            var watch = new Stopwatch();
            watch.Start();

            DoWork(input);

            watch.Stop();

            var time = watch.Elapsed;
            _logger.LogInformation($"Received: {input} from queue: {receiver}, took: {time}");
        }

        private void DoWork(string input)
        {
            foreach (var ch in input)
            {
                if (ch == '.')
                    Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
        }

    }
}
```

Compile as before and we're ready to execute the fanout sender and receiver.

```bash
cd tutorials\tutorial3
dotnet build
```

And of course, to execute the tutorial do the following:

To run the receiver, execute the following commands:

```bash
# receiver

cd receiver
dotnet run
```

Open another shell to run the sender:

```bash
# sender

cd sender
dotnet run
```

Using `rabbitmqctl list_bindings` you can verify that the code actually
creates bindings and queues as we want. With two `ReceiveLogs.java`
programs running you should see something like:
