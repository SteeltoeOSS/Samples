# Fortune-Teller-UI - ASP.NET Core MVC Application

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server) for discovering micro services. The Fortune-Teller-UI attempts to locate the fortuneService in the Eureka server and uses it to get your fortune.

## Running Local

### Running a Eureka Server

Refer to [common tasks](/CommonTasks.md#Spring-Cloud-Eureka-Server) for detailed instructions on running a local Eureka server.

## Building & Running - Local

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples`
1. `cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller/Fortune-Teller-UI`
1. `dotnet restore`
1. `dotnet run`

## What to expect - Local

After building and running the app, you should see something like the following:

```bash
$ cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller-UI
$ dotnet run
Hosting environment: Production
Now listening on: http://*:5555
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

At this point the Fortune Teller UI is up and running and ready for displaying your fortune. Hit <http://localhost:5555/> to see it!

## Running on Cloud Foundry

### Setup Service Registry on Cloud Foundry

Using the service instance name of `myDiscoveryService`, complete the [common task](/CommonTasks.md#Spring-Cloud-Eureka-Server) of provisioning a Eureka server.

## Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. Login and target your desired space/org: `cf target -o myorg -s myspace`
1. `cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller/Fortune-Teller-Service`
1. Publish the app, selecting the runtime you want to run on:
   - `dotnet publish -r linux-x64`
   - `dotnet publish -r win10-x64`
1. Push the app using the appropriate manifest:
   - `cf push -f manifest.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/linux-x64/publish`
   - `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/win10-x64/publish`

## What to expect - CloudFoundry

After building and running the app, you should see something like the following in the logs.

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs fortuneui`

On a Windows cell, you should see something like this during startup:

## Enabling SSL usage on Cloud Foundry

If you wish to use SSL communications between the Fortune Teller UI and the Fortune Teller Service, have a look at the comments in the files listed below.  You will need to make modifications to one or more of those files. Also, you are encouraged to read the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/adminguide/securing-traffic.html) on how SSL is configured, used and implemented before trying to use it with the Fortune Teller app.

1. `FortuneService.cs` - Changes needed to enable SSL usage when the Fortune Teller Service (i.e. Kestrel) is presenting Self-Signed certificates to the client.
