Go to your RabbitMQ broker queues:
You should see a queue named: `BasicSample.Basic`. This name is controlled by settings in the `appsettings.json`.

Type a string into the `Publish Message` section of the UI, and hit `Publish Message`

You will see a log message similar to this:

```bash
MyStreamProcssor changed input:test into output:TEST
```
