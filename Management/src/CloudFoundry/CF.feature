  In order to show you how to use Steeltoe Management Endpoint
  You can run some Steeltoe Management Endpoint samples

  @netcoreapp3.1
  @win10-x64
  Scenario: CloudFoundry Management (netcoreapp3.1/win10-x64)
    When you run: dotnet publish -f netcoreapp3.1 -r win10-x64
    And you run in the background: cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/win10-x64/publish
    And you wait until CloudFoundry app actuator is started
    Then you should be able to access CloudFoundry app actuator management endpoints

  @net5.0
  @win10-x64
  Scenario: CloudFoundry Management (net5.0/win10-x64)
    When you run: dotnet publish -f net5.0 -r win10-x64
    And you run in the background: cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/net5.0/win10-x64/publish
    And you wait until CloudFoundry app actuator is started
