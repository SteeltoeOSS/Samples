  You can run some PostgreSql connection samples

  Scenario: PostgreSql Connector (net6.0/win10)
    When you run: dotnet publish -r win10-x64 --self-contained
    And you run in the background: cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/net6.0/win10-x64/publish
    And you wait until CloudFoundry app postgres-connector is started
    When you get https://postgres-connector/Home/PostgresData

    And you should see "Key 2 = Row2 Text"
