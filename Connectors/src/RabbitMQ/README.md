# RabbitMQ Connector Sample App - RabbitMQConnection

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use the [Steeltoe RabbitMQ Connector](https://docs.steeltoe.io/api/v3/connectors/rabbitmq.html)
for connecting to a RabbitMQ server.
This sample illustrates using an `IConnection` to send and receive messages on the bound RabbitMQ service.

## General pre-requisites

1. Installed .NET 8 SDK
1. Optional: [VMware Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/index.html)
   (optionally with [Windows support](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/6.0/tas-for-vms/concepts-overview.html))
   with [VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ for Tanzu Application Service](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-RabbitMQ-for-Tanzu-Application-Service/index.html)
   and [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
1. Optional: [VMware Tanzu Platform for Kubernetes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Platform/services/create-manage-apps-tanzu-platform-k8s/overview.html) v1.5 or higher
   and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

## Running locally

1. Start a RabbitMQ [docker container](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/blob/main/CommonTasks.md)
1. Run the sample
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

To send a message over RabbitMQ: enter text and click the Send button.
To receive a RabbitMQ message that you have sent: click the Receive button. Messages will be retrieved from the queue one at a time.

## Running on Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry

1. Create a RabbitMQ service instance in an org/space
   ```
   cf target -o your-org -s your-space
   cf create-service p.rabbitmq single-node myRabbitMQService
   ```
1. Wait for the service to become ready (you can check with `cf services`)
1. Run the `cf push` command to deploy from source (you can monitor logs with `cf logs rabbitmq-connector`)
   - When deploying to Windows, binaries must be built locally before push. Use the following commands instead:
     ```
     dotnet publish -r win-x64 --self-contained
     cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Release/net8.0/win-x64/publish
     ```
1. Copy the value of `routes` in the output and open in your browser

## Running on Tanzu Platform for Kubernetes

### Create RabbitMQ class claim

In order to connect to RabbitMQ for this sample, you must have a class claim available for the application to bind to.
The commands listed below will create the claim, and the claim will be bound to the application via the definition
in the `workload.yaml` that is included in the `config` folder of this project.

```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=your-namespace
tanzu service class-claim create my-postgresql-service --class postgresql-unmanaged
```

If you'd like to learn more about these services, see [claiming services](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.5/tap/getting-started-claim-services.html)
and [consuming services](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.5/tap/getting-started-consume-services.html) in the documentation.

### App deployment

To deploy from local source code:
```
tanzu app workload apply --local-path . --file ./config/workload.yaml -y
```

Alternatively, from locally built binaries:
```
dotnet publish -r linux-x64 --no-self-contained
tanzu app workload apply --local-path ./bin/Release/net8.0/linux-x64/publish --file ./config/workload.yaml -y
```

See the [Tanzu documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.8/tap/getting-started-deploy-first-app.html) for details.
