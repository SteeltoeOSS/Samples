# RabbitMQ Connector Sample App - RabbitMQConnection

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/SteeltoeOSS/Steeltoe/_apis/build/status/Samples/SteeltoeOSS.Samples%20%5BConnectors_RabbitMQ%5D?branchName=2.x)](https://dev.azure.com/SteeltoeOSS/Steeltoe/_build/latest?definitionId=14&branchName=main)

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Steeltoe RabbitMQ Connector](https://docs.steeltoe.io/api/v3/connectors/rabbitmq.html) for connecting to a RabbitMQ service on CloudFoundry. This specific sample illustrates how to use a `RabbitMQ.Client` to send and receive messages on the bound RabbitMQ service.

## Pre-requisites - CloudFoundry

1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry 1.7+
1. (Optional) installed Windows support
1. Installed RabbitMQ CloudFoundry service
1. Installed .NET Core SDK

## Create RabbitMQ Service Instance on CloudFoundry

You must first create an instance of the RabbitMQ service in a org/space.

1. `cf target -o myorg -s development`
1. `cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard myRabbitMQService`

## Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. `cf target -o myorg -s development`
1. `cd samples/Connectors/src/RabbitMQ`
1. `dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config`
1. Publish app to a local directory, specifying the framework and runtime (select ONE of these commands):
   * `dotnet publish -f netcoreapp3.1 -r linux-x64`
1. Push the app using the appropriate manifest (select ONE of these commands):
   * `cf push -f manifest.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/linux-x64/publish`

> Note: The provided manifest will create an app named `rabbitmq-connector` and attempt to bind the app to RabbitMQ service `myRabbitMQService`.

## What to expect - CloudFoundry

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs rabbitmq-connector`

On a Linux cell, you should see something like this during startup:

```bash

```

This sample will be available at <http://rabbitmq-connector.[your-cf-apps-domain]/>.

To send a message over RabbitMQ: click "Send" in the menu, enter text and click the Send button.
To receive a RabbitMQ message that you have sent: click "Receive" in the menu, and messages will be retrieved from the queue one at a time (per page view).
