# RabbitMQ Connector Sample App - RabbitMQConnection

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Steeltoe RabbitMQ Connector](https://docs.steeltoe.io/api/v3/connectors/rabbitmq.html) for connecting to a RabbitMQ service on CloudFoundry.
This sample illustrates using a `RabbitMQ.Client` to send and receive messages on the bound RabbitMQ service.

## General prerequisites

1. Installed .NET Core SDK

## Running locally

1. Started RabbitMQ [docker container](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/blob/main/CommonTasks.md)

## Running on CloudFoundry

1. Installed CloudFoundry (optionally with Windows support)
1. Installed RabbitMQ CloudFoundry service

## Create RabbitMQ Service Instance on CloudFoundry

You must first create an instance of the RabbitMQ service in an org/space.

1. `cf target -o your-org -s your-space`
1. `cf create-service p.rabbitmq single-node myRabbitMQService`

## Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. `cf target -o your-org -s your-space`
1. `cd samples/Connectors/src/RabbitMQ`
1. Push the app
   - When using Windows containers:
     - Publish app to a local directory, specifying the runtime:
       * `dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config`
       * `dotnet publish -r win-x64 --self-contained`
     - Push the app using the appropriate manifest:
       * `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/net6.0/win-x64/publish`
   - Otherwise:
     - Push the app using the appropriate manifest:
       * `cf push -f manifest.yml`

> Note: The provided manifest will create an app named `rabbitmq-connector` and attempt to bind the app to RabbitMQ service `myRabbitMQService`.

## What to expect - CloudFoundry

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs rabbitmq-connector`

On a Linux cell, you should see something like this during startup:
